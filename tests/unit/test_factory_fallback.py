"""Unit tests for ``_build_fallback`` (Task 5.2).

Locks the contract from plan.md §2.4 and tasks.md T5.4:

* A ``FALLBACK_ORDER`` containing at least one real provider returns a
  ``FallbackModel`` instance — proves the env-driven member resolver is
  wired through ``get_model`` recursion (Req 4.1 / 4.2).
* A ``FALLBACK_ORDER`` whose every member is in ``_MVP_STUB_PROVIDERS``
  raises :class:`RuntimeError` at build time so the misconfiguration
  fails fast at app startup rather than at the first ``/chat`` call
  (Req 4.5 構成段). plan.md §2.4 names this the "all-stub" guard.
* Settings-level rejections (empty ``FALLBACK_ORDER`` / wholly unknown
  provider names) do **not** appear here: the
  ``Settings._check_provider_constraints`` validator runs first and
  raises ``pydantic.ValidationError`` before ``_build_fallback`` is ever
  invoked. Those cases are covered by ``tests/unit/test_config.py``;
  asserting them again here would test pydantic-settings, not
  ``_build_fallback``.
