"""Deep Research application-layer contracts (Spec 009-deep-research Req 2.1).

This module is the single source of truth for the Deep Research pattern's
brief / plan / finding / report Pydantic models and the ``ProgressEvent``
discriminated union; the normative copy also lives in
``patterns/deep-research/README.md`` fenced block, asserted equal by the
single-point drift test (Spec 006-2a NFR-5). The Deep Research lane
(``patterns_deep_research``) imports these via the ``patterns/contracts`` path
dependency rather than duplicating them (NFR-3).

Deep Research is an *application layer* (not one of the six workflow patterns):
an orchestrator/lead agent decomposes a query into a ``ResearchBrief`` +
``ResearchPlan`` of self-contained ``SubQuestion``s, bounded parallel
sub-researchers each run a search→read→reflect loop and return a ``Finding``,
and a report writer synthesises a ``ResearchReport`` (Anthropic multi-agent
research system / langchain open_deep_research / local-deep-research).

``Citation`` is **reused** from :mod:`patterns_contracts.rag` (not redefined
here): a research claim is grounded exactly like a RAG answer's claim — a source
anchor that must point at a result the researcher actually saw. The drift test
enforces one-class-one-README ownership, so ``Citation`` stays documented in the
RAG README and is only *referenced* in the Deep Research README, never re-declared.

The grounding invariants (≥1 citation per ``Finding``, no dangling citation) and
the cap-enforcement flags (``truncated``) are enforced in the lane pipeline
(``patterns_deep_research.compression`` / ``.research``), not as field
constraints here — the contract stays a plain, dependency-zero shape.

The ``ProgressEvent`` ``Annotated`` union is skipped symmetrically by the drift
parser (it is neither a model class nor a ``Literal``), matching the ``SseEvent``
precedent; each member's ``type`` ``Literal`` doubles as a progress-event name a
consumer (e.g. the SSE lane) can map onto its own wire vocabulary.
